## Introduction

Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator that empowers developers to build high-performance websites with ease...after you get acquainted with some of its nuances. This guide is more of a living docu series through setting up a Hugo site, configuring a theme, managing front matter, and creating a personalized "About Me" page, allowing for more confident and complex setups in the future.

## Installing Hugo

Before diving in, ensure Hugo is installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (if needed).
2. Ensure you have Git installed: `git --version`.

### Steps to Install Hugo

1. **Install via Package Manager**:
   - **macOS**: `brew install hugo`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install hugo`
   - **Windows**: Use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/): `choco install hugo`

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash

   This command should return the version of Hugo installed.

## Creating a New Hugo Site

1. Open your terminal and create a new site:
   ```bash
   hugo new site my-hugo-site
   cd my-hugo-site
   ```

2. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

---

## Configuring a Theme

Themes define your site's layout and design. Hugo offers a range of free and premium themes.

### Downloading a Theme

1. Browse themes at [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/).
2. Add your chosen theme as a Git submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/theme-repo/theme-name.git themes/theme-name
   ```

### Applying the Theme

1. Open the `config.toml` file.
2. Add the theme name:
   ```toml
   theme = "theme-name"
   ```

3. Test the site locally:
   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```

## Configuring Front Matter

### What is Front Matter?

Front matter is metadata included at the top of content files. It controls how Hugo processes and displays the content.

### Example Front Matter

Below is an example of a blog post's front matter in `content/posts/my-first-post.md`:
```toml
+++
title = "My First Post"
date = 2024-11-27
draft = false
tags = ["introduction", "hugo"]
categories = ["blog"]
description = "An introduction to my Hugo blog."
+++
```

### Customizing Front Matter

You can extend front matter to include custom fields:
```toml
+++
title = "Custom Post"
author = "Your Name"
readingTime = 5
summary = "A brief overview of this post."
+++
```

Use these fields in templates by referencing them in your theme:
```html
<p>Author: {{ .Params.author }}</p>
<p>Reading Time: {{ .Params.readingTime }} minutes</p>
```

---

## Creating a Custom 'About Me' Page

### Structuring the Markdown File

1. Create a new file:
   ```bash
   hugo new about.md
   ```

2. Open the file and edit its content:
   ```toml
   +++
   title = "About Me"
   date = 2024-11-27
   draft = false
   +++
   ```

3. Add your content below the front matter:
   ```markdown
   # About Me

   Hello! I'm [Your Name], a web developer passionate about building fast and reliable websites.
   ```

### Adding Custom Styles

To style the "About Me" page:
1. Open or create a custom CSS file in `assets/css/custom.css`.
2. Add your styles:
   ```css
   .about-title {
       font-size: 2.5rem;
       color: #4a90e2;
   }
   ```

3. Reference the CSS file in your layout. In `layouts/_default/baseof.html`:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ "css/custom.css" | relURL }}">
   ```

4. Update the Markdown file to use a custom class:
   ```markdown
   # About Me {.about-title}

   Welcome to my page!
   ```

## Testing and Deploying Your Site

1. Test your site locally:
   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```
   Visit [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to preview changes.

2. Build the site for deployment:
   ```bash
   hugo
   ```

3. Deploy your site to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. For example:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial site setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Conclusion

Setting up Hugo allows you to build a fast, customizable website with ease. By configuring a theme, optimizing front matter, and creating a personalized "About Me" page, you can craft a professional site tailored to your needs (hint hint). 

In future installments, I'll be exploring and implementing additional Hugo features like shortcodes, custom datetime formats in front matter, defining front matter in the root Hugo config, & custom layouts to enhance this site further.
